# Be Framework

> "Objects don't do things—they become what they are meant to be"

Be Framework is an ontological programming framework that transforms how we think about code. Instead of commanding objects to perform actions, we create conditions for objects to naturally become their intended forms.

## Quick Start

- **[Manual](/manual/)** - Complete learning guide from basics to advanced concepts
- **[Conventions](/manual/convention/)** - Project organization and coding standards
- **[Examples](/example/)** - Working code demonstrations

## Core Philosophy

**From Doing → Being**
- Traditional: `$user->validate(); $user->save();`
- Be Framework: `$validatedUser = new ValidatedUser($userInput);`

**Type-Safe Transformations**
- Each transformation step is a distinct type
- Invalid states cannot exist by design
- Clear progression: Input → Being → Final
