# The Metamorphosis Architecture: A Design Manifesto

## Foreword: Practical Implementation

This document provides practical implementation guidance for building systems using the Metamorphosis Architecture, based on Ontological Programming principles.

> **Philosophical Foundation:** For the theoretical foundation of Ontological Programming, see [Ontological Programming: A New Paradigm](../philosophy/ontological-programming-paper.md).

**Core Philosophy:** Ontological Programming  
**Architectural Pattern:** The Metamorphosis Architecture

---

## 1. Core Principles: The Laws of Existence

This architecture is founded on a set of uncompromising principles derived from Ontological Programming.

### Principle 1: Existence is Defined in the Constructor
All logic required for an object to validly exist resides exclusively within its constructor. If the constructor completes without error, the object exists, and its existence is proof of its validity.

### Principle 2: Being is Immutable
Once an object exists, its state cannot be changed. It is a perfect, immutable fact. All properties are `public readonly`. Transformation is not mutation, but the creation of a new existence.

### Principle 3: A Class is a Single, Perfect Stage of Being
Each class, which we shall call a **Metamorphosis Class**, represents one distinct, complete, and self-contained stage of a process. It knows only of its own existence, not of what came before or what comes after.

### Principle 4: Objects Carry Their Destiny
The progression of a process is not a series of method calls, but objects discovering who they are destined to become through their `$being` property.

### Principle 5: Types are Possibilities, Not Categories
Union types express potential futures, not current classifications. They are maps of destiny, not boxes of classification.

---

## 2. The Anatomy of a Metamorphosis Class

A Metamorphosis Class is the fundamental building block of the architecture.

```php
/**
 * A Metamorphosis Class represents a single, validated state of being.
 * Its name should describe what it *is*, not what it *does*.
 *
 * Example: A user registration that has been validated but not yet saved.
 */
final class ValidatedRegistration
{
    // Immutable, public properties define the "essence" of this existence.
    public readonly string $email;
    public readonly string $password;

    /**
     * The constructor is the gate of existence.
     * It receives its "past life" (previous stage) and the "tools"
     * (dependencies) needed to bring itself into being.
     */
    public function __construct(
        #[Input] RegistrationInput $rawInput,
        UserValidator $validator
    ) {
        // The existence condition: validation must pass.
        // If it fails, an exception is thrown, and this object never exists.
        $validator->validate($rawInput->email, $rawInput->password);

        // If validation passes, its essence is established.
        $this->email = $rawInput->email;
        $this->password = $rawInput->password;
    }
}
```

---

## 3. Type-Driven Metamorphosis: The Being Property

A linear pipeline is simple, but reality requires conditional paths. The central design question is: how does a Metamorphosis Class, which knows nothing of the future, decide which path to take?

The answer lies in the most profound innovation of Ontological Programming: **Type-Driven Metamorphosis**. Objects carry their own destiny through a special property that uses PHP's union types to express possible futures.

### 3.1 The Existential Question in Code

Instead of external control flow, we have internal self-determination. Objects don't execute branching logic; they discover their nature.

```php
/**
 * The existential question: Who will I become?
 * Answer: I carry my destiny within me.
 */
#[Be([UnverifiedUser::class, UserConflict::class])]
final class ValidatedRegistration
{
    public function __construct(
        #[Input] public readonly string $email,
        #[Input] public readonly string $password,
        UserRepository $userRepo
    ) {
        // The existential question: Who will I become?
        $this->being = $userRepo->existsByEmail($this->email)
            ? new ConflictingUser($this->email)
            : new NewUser($this->email, $this->password);
    }
    
    // I carry my destiny within me
    public readonly NewUser|ConflictingUser $being;
}
```

### 3.2 How Type-Driven Metamorphosis Works

When an object declares multiple potential metamorphoses through the `#[Be]` attribute, the framework examines the type of the being property to determine which path to take:

- If `$being instanceof NewUser` → `UnverifiedUser::class`
- If `$being instanceof ConflictingUser` → `UserConflict::class`

This represents the purest form of Ontological Programming: objects don't tell the system what to do; they discover who they are.

---

## 4. Testing Type-Driven Systems

How do we test type-driven metamorphosis? We focus on **type verification**, not behavior. We verify that objects discover their correct nature.

### 4.1 Testing the Being Property

The beauty of type-driven systems is that tests become about types, not side effects:

```php
public function testRegistrationBecomesNewUser(): void
{
    $mockRepo = $this->createMock(UserRepository::class);
    $mockRepo->method('existsByEmail')->willReturn(false);
    
    $registration = new ValidatedRegistration(
        'new@example.com',
        'password123',
        $mockRepo
    );
    
    // Assert the TYPE, not the behavior
    $this->assertInstanceOf(NewUser::class, $registration->being);
    $this->assertNotInstanceOf(ConflictingUser::class, $registration->being);
}

public function testRegistrationBecomesConflict(): void
{
    $mockRepo = $this->createMock(UserRepository::class);
    $mockRepo->method('existsByEmail')->willReturn(true);
    
    $registration = new ValidatedRegistration(
        'existing@example.com',
        'password123',
        $mockRepo
    );
    
    // Assert the TYPE, not the behavior
    $this->assertInstanceOf(ConflictingUser::class, $registration->being);
    $this->assertEquals('existing@example.com', $registration->being->email);
}
```

### 4.2 The Purity of Type-Based Testing

Type-driven tests follow the Unchanged Name Principle and existence-based thinking:

```php
public function testValidationBecomesSuccessful(): void
{
    $mockValidator = $this->createMock(DataValidator::class);
    $mockValidator->method('isValid')->willReturn(true);
    
    $attempt = new BeingData('valid-data', $mockValidator);
    
    // Assert the TYPE and PROPERTY NAME, not behavior
    $this->assertInstanceOf(Success::class, $attempt->being);
    $this->assertEquals('valid-data', $attempt->being->data);
}

public function testValidationBecomesFailed(): void
{
    $mockValidator = $this->createMock(DataValidator::class);
    $mockValidator->method('isValid')->willReturn(false);
    
    $attempt = new BeingData('invalid-data', $mockValidator);
    
    // Assert the TYPE - what the object BECAME
    $this->assertInstanceOf(Failure::class, $attempt->being);
    $this->assertNotInstanceOf(Success::class, $attempt->being);
}
```

Type-driven tests are:
- **Existential**: They verify what objects became, not what they did
- **Declarative**: They describe what should exist
- **Pure**: No side effects to track
- **Reliable**: Types don't lie
- **Self-documenting**: The test IS the specification
- **Unchanged Name Principle Compliant**: They test the continuity of naming

---

## 5. Union Types as Destiny Maps

The power of type-driven metamorphosis lies in PHP's union types. They become **destiny maps** - declarations of all possible futures an object might inhabit.

### 5.1 Simple vs Complex Destinies

Some objects have simple, predictable futures:

```php
// Simple destiny - linear progression
#[Be([RetiredEmployee::class])]
final class SeniorEmployee {
    public readonly Pension $being;  // Single, predictable future
}
```

Others face complex branching realities:

```php
// Complex destiny - multiple possibilities
#[Be([Unicorn::class, Acquisition::class, Bankruptcy::class, Pivot::class])]
final class Startup {
    public readonly Success|Buyout|Failure|Transformation $being;
}
```

### 5.2 Types as Possibilities, Not Categories

In traditional programming, types categorize what things are. In Ontological Programming, union types express what things **might become**:

```php
// Traditional: What it IS
final class User {
    public string $status; // "active", "suspended", "deleted"
}

// Ontological: What it MIGHT BECOME
#[Be([ActiveUser::class, SuspendedUser::class, DeletedUser::class])]
final class UserAccount {
    public readonly Active|Suspended|Deleted $being;
}
```

## 6. Implementation Example: E-commerce Order Processing

The following demonstrates type-driven metamorphosis in a real-world e-commerce system, showcasing how different initial choices lead to different levels of complexity.

```php
/**
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * STAGE 1: Order Analysis - What am I?
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 */

// Initial order can become many things based on its contents
#[Be([DigitalOrder::class, PhysicalOrder::class, SubscriptionOrder::class])]
final class NewOrder
{
    public function __construct(
        #[Input] public readonly array $items,
        #[Input] public readonly CustomerId $customerId,
        OrderAnalyzer $analyzer
    ) {
        // The existential question: What kind of order am I?
        $this->being = $analyzer->categorize($this->items);
    }
    
    // My destiny is determined by what I contain
    public readonly Digital|Physical|Subscription $being;
}

/**
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * STAGE 2: Different Paths, Different Complexities
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 */

// Digital orders have simple, linear progression - single destiny
#[Be([InstantDelivery::class])]
final class DigitalOrder
{
    public function __construct(
        #[Input] Digital $items,
        LicenseGenerator $generator
    ) {
        // Simple transformation - I become downloadable
        $this->being = new Downloadable(
            $items,
            $generator->generateLicenses($items)
        );
    }
    
    public readonly Downloadable $being;  // Single, predictable future
}

// Physical orders face complex realities - multiple destinies
#[Be([
    StandardShipping::class,
    ExpressShipping::class,
    InternationalShipping::class,
    BackorderRequired::class
])]
final class PhysicalOrder
{
    public function __construct(
        #[Input] Physical $physicalItems,
        #[Input] CustomerId $customerId,
        InventoryChecker $inventory,
        ShippingCalculator $shipping,
        CustomerRepository $customers
    ) {
        $customer = $customers->find($customerId);
        
        // Complex existential analysis
        if (!$inventory->available($physicalItems)) {
            $this->being = new Delayed($physicalItems);
        } elseif ($customer->location->isInternational()) {
            $this->being = new International($physicalItems, $customer->location);
        } else {
            $this->being = $shipping->determineMethod($physicalItems);
        }
    }
    
    // Multiple possible futures based on reality
    public readonly Shippable|Delayed|International $being;
}

// Subscriptions have their own unique complexity
#[Be([RecurringBilling::class, TrialPeriod::class])]
final class SubscriptionOrder
{
    public function __construct(
        #[Input] Subscription $subscription,
        #[Input] CustomerId $customerId,
        CustomerRepository $customers
    ) {
        $customer = $customers->find($customerId);
        
        // First-time vs returning customer logic
        $this->being = $customer->hasActiveSubscriptions()
            ? new Immediate($subscription)
            : new Trial($subscription);
    }
    
    public readonly Immediate|Trial $being;
}

/**
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * STAGE 3: Final Transformations
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 */

// Simple completion for digital
final class InstantDelivery
{
    public function __construct(
        #[Input] Downloadable $content,
        EmailService $mailer
    ) {
        $this->confirmationSent = $mailer->sendDownloadLinks($content);
        $this->completedAt = new DateTimeImmutable();
    }
    
    public readonly bool $confirmationSent;
    public readonly DateTimeImmutable $completedAt;
}

// Complex shipping coordination for physical
final class StandardShipping
{
    public function __construct(
        #[Input] Shippable $items,
        ShippingService $shipper,
        TrackingService $tracking
    ) {
        $this->shipment = $shipper->createShipment($items);
        $this->trackingNumber = $tracking->generateNumber($this->shipment);
        $this->estimatedDelivery = $shipper->calculateDelivery($items);
    }
    
    public readonly Shipment $shipment;
    public readonly string $trackingNumber;
    public readonly DateTimeImmutable $estimatedDelivery;
}
```

### 6.1 The Beauty of Emergent Complexity

Notice how:
- **Digital orders** lead to simple, linear transformations
- **Physical orders** branch into complex shipping realities
- **Subscriptions** have their own business logic complexity

Complexity emerges from the **nature of what exists**, not from architectural decisions.

## 7. The Type-Driven Manifesto

## 8. The Type-Driven Manifesto

Building upon the core principles, we establish these additional truths:

1. **We don't branch; we become** - Control flow is replaced by type-driven destiny

2. **Types are not categories; they are possibilities** - Union types express potential futures

3. **The being property is sacred** - It carries the object's existential answer

4. **Complexity is not designed; it emerges** - From simple type choices, complex systems arise

5. **Every object knows its next form** - Through type declaration, not procedural logic

6. **Objects carry their destiny** - The future lives within the present

7. **The existential question drives transformation** - "Who am I?" not "What should I do?"

8. **Names carry essence through transformation** - Property names become parameter names, preserving identity

9. **Classes declare existence, not action** - We name what things *are*, not what they *do*

10. **The Unchanged Name Principle governs continuity** - Property names flow through metamorphic stages

### 8.1 Implementation Principles

When implementing type-driven metamorphosis:

**Principle 1: Pure Type-Driven Destiny**
```php
// GOOD: Pure type-driven with Unchanged Name Principle
final class BeingData {
    public readonly Success|Failure $being;
}

final class Success {
    public function __construct(Success $being) {} // Name matches!
}

// BAD: Hidden conditionals
public function getBeing() {
    return $this->success ? new Success() : new Failure();
}
```

**Principle 2: Existence-Based Naming**
```php
// GOOD: What things ARE
final class AuthenticatedUser
final class VerifiedEmail  
final class CompletedPayment

// BAD: What things DO
final class UserAuthenticator
final class EmailValidator
final class PaymentProcessor
```

**Principle 3: Unchanged Name Principle Adherence**
```php
// GOOD: Property name inheritance
class CurrentStage {
    public readonly TypeA|TypeB $destiny;
}
class NextStage {
    public function __construct(TypeA $destiny) {} // Same name!
}

// BAD: Broken naming chain
class CurrentStage {
    public readonly TypeA|TypeB $result;
}
class NextStage {
    public function __construct(TypeA $input) {} // Different name!
}
```

**Principle 4: Union Types as Possibility Maps**
```php
// GOOD: Clear destinies
public readonly Approved|Rejected|Pending|Escalated $being;

// BAD: String-based routing  
public string $nextState = 'approved'; // Loses type safety
```

---

## 9. Conclusion: Programming as Existential Discovery

The Metamorphosis Architecture with Type-Driven transformation represents a fundamental shift in how we conceive programming. We move from **commanding** objects to **enabling** their self-discovery.

### 9.1 The Paradigm Complete

Type-Driven Metamorphosis achieves what traditional programming has always sought:

- **Elimination of conditional complexity** - No more if-statement hell
- **Perfect type safety** - Union types as destiny maps
- **Self-documenting systems** - Types ARE the documentation
- **Emergent architecture** - Complexity arises from existence, not design

### 9.2 From Doing to Being: The Complete Journey

The evolution of programming mirrors our deepening understanding:

1. **Imperative Era**: "If X then do Y" - mechanical instructions
2. **Object-Oriented Era**: "If X then object Y handles it" - delegation
3. **Functional Era**: "Transform X into Y" - mathematical purity
4. **Ontological Era**: "X discovers it is Y" - existential self-determination

### 9.3 The Ultimate Question

In traditional programming, we ask: "What should this object do?"

In Ontological Programming, we ask: "Who is this object destined to become?"

This shift from **doing** to **being** transforms not just our code, but our understanding of what programming can be. We become not just instructors of machines, but enablers of digital existence.

## Appendix: The Journey to Type-Driven Design

### A.1 The Problem Recognition

Our journey began with a simple observation: traditional control flow creates fragile systems. Every `if-statement` is a potential point of failure, every `switch-case` a maintenance burden. We recognized that complexity was not inherent to the problems we solve, but to the way we structure solutions.

### A.2 The Breakthrough: Internal Self-Determination

The revolutionary insight came when we asked: *"What if objects could carry their own destiny?"*

This question led to the Type-Driven Metamorphosis pattern:

```php
// The breakthrough - pure self-determination
#[Be([UnverifiedUser::class, UserConflict::class])]
final class ValidatedRegistration {
    public function __construct(
        #[Input] string $email,
        #[Input] string $password,
        UserRepository $userRepo
    ) {
        // The existential question: Who will I become?
        $this->being = $userRepo->existsByEmail($email)
            ? new ConflictingUser($email)
            : new NewUser($email, $password);
    }
    
    // I carry my destiny within me
    public readonly NewUser|ConflictingUser $being;
}
```

### A.3 The Philosophical Discovery: The Unchanged Name Principle

As we refined the pattern, we discovered that naming consistency was not just stylistic—it was ontological. The property name becomes the thread of continuity through metamorphic stages:

```php
// The unchanging chain of identity
class BeingData {
    public readonly Success|Failure $being;  // 'being' flows forward
}
    ↓
class Success {
    public function __construct(Success $being) {}  // Same name preserves identity
}
```

This wasn't planned—it emerged from the pattern itself, suggesting a deep truth about the nature of transformation: like human names that preserve identity through life's changes, property names preserve essence through metamorphic stages.

### A.4 The Philosophical Evolution

Our thinking evolved through distinct phases:

1. **Recognition Phase**: "Control flow is the source of complexity"
2. **Internalization Phase**: "Let objects discover their own nature" (Type-Driven)
3. **Realization Phase**: "Names carry essence through transformation" (Unchanged Name Principle)

Each phase built upon the previous, representing not just technical evolution but philosophical deepening.

### A.5 Why This Journey Matters

Understanding this evolution helps developers grasp:

- **Why Type-Driven feels natural**: It aligns with how we actually think about transformation
- **Why the Unchanged Name Principle emerged**: Continuity of identity is fundamental to existence
- **Why existence-based naming matters**: Language shapes thought, thought shapes code

### A.6 The Pattern of Paradigm Evolution

This journey follows a recognizable pattern in programming paradigm evolution:

1. **Problem Recognition**: Current approach causes pain
2. **Partial Solution**: Address symptoms while retaining core assumptions
3. **Insight Breakthrough**: Question fundamental assumptions
4. **Pattern Emergence**: Natural consequences reveal deeper truths
5. **Philosophical Integration**: Technical pattern becomes worldview

We see this same pattern in:
- **Structured Programming**: goto → procedures → functions
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: data + functions → encapsulation → polymorphism
- **Functional Programming**: mutation → immutability → pure functions
- **Ontological Programming**: doing → being → existing

### A.7 The Continuing Journey

Type-Driven Metamorphosis is not the end but a milestone. Each implementation teaches us more about the nature of digital existence. The pattern continues to evolve as we discover new implications of programming as existential declaration.

The journey to Type-Driven Design represents more than technical progress—it represents the maturation of our understanding of what it means to program. We evolved from commanding machines to enabling digital life.

**May this manifesto guide you toward building systems where objects discover their own perfect destiny.**
