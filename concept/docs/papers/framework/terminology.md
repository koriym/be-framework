# Being Paradigm Terminology

A concise glossary of key terms in the Being Paradigm, listed alphabetically for quick reference.

## A

### Augmented Decision Making (AMD)
An approach combining deterministic rules, AI pattern recognition, and human intuition to handle complex decisions. Preserves rich context and embraces uncertainty through Undetermined states.

## B

### #[Be] Attribute
A declaration of what an object is destined to become. Enables Type-Driven Metamorphosis by mapping object types to their next transformation stage.  
*Example: `#[Be([Success::class, Failure::class])]`

### Being Class
The foundational concept in Ontological Programming representing objects that exist in time, carry their nature, and undergo self-determined transformation. Embodies temporal existence and subject-object unity.

### being life
Objects that exist, change, and have meaning. The ultimate expression of the Being Paradigm where code becomes alive through the integration of Being + Change + Meaning.

### Being Property
A special property (typically `$being`) using union types to express an object's potential futures or destiny. Enables internal self-determination.  
*Example: `public readonly Success|Failure $being;`

## C

### Constructor Workshop Theory
The principle that constructors are complete workshops of transformation where all logic resides, tools are used once, and the transformed self emerges immutable.

## E

### Existence as Proof
The principle that if something exists, it is correct by definition. Encompasses both Construction is Proof and Semantic Variables are Proof.

### Existence Contract
A declaration of what must exist for an entity to exist, what it is when it exists, and what its existence enables.

### Existential Question
The internal process by which objects discover their own nature through self-assessment, typically expressed as "Who am I?" in the being property.

## F

### Fork-Join Pattern
A parallel assembly pattern where a single context initiates multiple parallel transformations that later converge into a composite object.

## I

### #[Input] Attribute
Marks constructor parameters that inherit data from the previous metamorphosis stage.

### #[Inject] Attribute
Marks constructor parameters that receive transient capabilities from the dependency injection container.

### Immanent
What the object already is—its inherent identity and essence that it carries from its previous state. In constructor parameters, represents the continuation of identity through transformation.

## L

### Linear Metamorphic Chain
A sequential transformation pattern where each stage leads deterministically to the next: A → B → C → D.

## M

### Metamorphic Programming
The implementation layer of the Being Paradigm focusing on object transformation through stages of existence.

## N

### Nature
The inherent essence of a Being that guides its transformation without external control.

## O

### Ontological Programming
A programming paradigm where objects focus on "being" rather than "doing," modeling software after existential concepts with immutability and self-determination.

## P

### Public Readonly Properties
The principle that all object properties are public and immutable, ensuring transparency and preventing state mutation.

## S

### SchemaLogger
A logging mechanism capturing complete execution stories as structured logs, enabling AI analysis to discover potential object evolutions.

### Semantic Variable Names
Variable names that carry meaning and validation contracts, where the existence of a properly named variable serves as proof of its validity.

### Subject-Object Unity
The philosophical principle that in the Being Paradigm, all objects are their own subjects—there is no external controller commanding objects.

## T

### Temporal Being
The aspect of Being Classes that exist in time with memory of past and knowledge of potential futures.

### Transcendent
What the world provides to the object—external context, capabilities, and meaning that enable transformation. In constructor parameters, represents the external forces that interact with immanent identity to create new being.

### Type-Driven Metamorphosis
The mechanism where objects use union types and the being property to self-determine their next form, eliminating explicit control flow.

## U

### Unchanged Name Principle
The principle that property names remain consistent across metamorphic stages to preserve identity and continuity through transformation.

### Undetermined State
A state representing an object's honest acknowledgment of its limitations, triggering delegation to appropriate expertise through the #[Accept] pattern.

### Union Type Destiny
The use of union types to express all possible futures an object might inhabit, serving as destiny maps rather than classifications.

## W

### "Whether?"
The fundamental question of Ontological Programming—asking what can exist rather than how things should be done. Contrasts with "How?" (Imperative), "Who?" (OOP), and "What?" (Functional).
