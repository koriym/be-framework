# When Tests Become Examples

> **"The fish knows its own joy through being, not through external verification."**

## Abstract

What happens when the responsibility for proof shifts from external tests to the objects themselves? This paper explores an emerging paradigm where objects carry their own temporal evidence within their structure, transforming testing from external verification to internal exemplification. Through an ancient Chinese dialogue about fish and happiness, we discover that the deepest questions about knowledge and verification have been waiting for us all along, embedded in the very nature of existence itself.

## A Walk by the River

Picture this: Two ancient Chinese philosophers, Zhuangzi and Huizi, are walking by a river. The conversation that follows might seem unrelated to software development, but it contains the key to understanding why testing has always felt slightly wrong—and what we might do about it.

**Zhuangzi**, watching fish swim in the water, remarks casually: "Look how happy the fish are!"

**Huizi**, ever the skeptic, immediately objects: "You are not a fish. How can you know whether fish are happy?"

Zhuangzi pauses, then smiles: "You are not me. How can you know that I don't know whether fish are happy?"

This gentle exchange, recorded over two thousand years ago, illuminates something profound about knowledge, verification, and the nature of internal versus external understanding. It also reveals why our modern approach to testing software systems might be fundamentally confused.

## The Testing Problem We've Always Lived With

Every programmer knows the rhythm: write code, write tests, run tests, fix failures, repeat. We've built entire methodologies around this cycle—Test-Driven Development, Behavior-Driven Development, countless frameworks for mocking, stubbing, and asserting. Yet something about this process has always felt slightly artificial.

Consider what happens when we test user deletion:

```php
public function testUserDeletion(): void {
    $this->service->deleteUser('user123');
    $this->assertNull($this->repository->find('user123'));
}
```

We delete a user, then immediately try to find them again to "prove" they're gone. It's as if we don't trust our own deletion method—or perhaps more accurately, as if we've structured our systems so they cannot be trusted to know their own states.

But wait. If we cannot trust our deletion method, why should we trust our finding method? If our repository might lie about deletion, why not about retrieval? We've created what philosophers call an infinite regress: every verification requires another verification, with no natural place to stop.

This is Huizi's problem projected into code. Just as Huizi demands external proof of Zhuangzi's internal knowledge about fish happiness, our testing frameworks demand external proof of our systems' internal states.

## What If Objects Could Know Themselves?

Here's a curious question: what would happen if objects could carry proof of their own temporal events? Not claims about what happened, but the actual temporal structure of what occurred, embedded in their very being?

Consider this alternative:

```php
final class DeletedUser {
    public function __construct(
        public readonly string $userId,
        public readonly BeenDeleted $been
    ) {}
}
```

The `BeenDeleted` is not a flag or a status—it's a temporal completion. It carries within itself the complete context of the deletion event: why it happened, when it happened, who authorized it, what evidence supports it. The object doesn't claim to be deleted; it embodies the completed temporal event of deletion.

The specific structure of `Been` objects varies by context. A `BeenDeleted` might carry actor, timestamp, and reason. A `BeenApproved` might include authorization level, approver role, and compliance evidence. A `BeenProcessed` might contain execution duration, resource usage, and output quality metrics. Each temporal completion carries exactly the contextual information needed to make that completion internally verifiable.

This is temporal completion as object property. The `readonly` modifier is crucial—it represents the irreversibility that characterizes genuine temporal events. Just as we cannot undo the Big Bang (though we can still observe its effects in cosmic background radiation), we cannot undo a temporal completion once it has occurred.

## The Discovery of Been

The power of this approach becomes apparent when we realize that temporal completion has always existed in natural systems—we've just never noticed it in computational ones.

Your immune system doesn't "test" whether it has encountered a pathogen before. When a B-cell meets a familiar antigen, it responds instantly because it carries the temporal record of previous exposure in its molecular structure. The antibody response is not verification but recognition—the immune system knows its own history through internal temporal structure.

DNA carries four billion years of evolutionary temporal completions. Each gene is a `BeenEvolved` record, a temporal proof of successful adaptation that doesn't require external verification. The gene's existence is the verification of its evolutionary success.

Even consciousness itself works this way. You don't verify your memories by checking external sources—you carry them as internal temporal completions that shape present experience. A traumatic memory is not a claim about past events but a present `BeenTraumatized` state that influences current reality.

## Zhuangzi's Insight Applied

Now we can see why Zhuangzi's response to Huizi is so profound. He's not just making a clever logical point—he's revealing something deep about the nature of internal knowledge itself.

When Huizi demands external verification of Zhuangzi's claim about fish happiness, he's assuming that internal states require external confirmation. But this assumption is self-defeating: if internal states cannot be known from outside, then Huizi cannot know that Zhuangzi doesn't know the fish's internal state.

Applied to software: when we require external tests to verify internal object states, we're making the same assumption. We're saying that objects cannot be trusted to know their own states. But if objects cannot know themselves, why should we trust our testing objects to know the states of the objects they're testing?

The `Been` paradigm embodies Zhuangzi's insight: objects can and do know their own states through internal temporal structure. A `DeletedUser` with a `BeenDeleted` property knows that it represents a completed deletion not through external confirmation but through internal temporal coherence.

## When Tests Transform into Examples

What happens to testing when objects become self-evidencing? Something beautiful: tests stop being tests and become examples.

Traditional testing:
```php
public function testUserValidation(): void {
    $validator = new UserValidator();
    $result = $validator->validate($invalidData);
    $this->assertFalse($result->isValid());  // Doubt, then verify
}
```

Example-based demonstration:
```php
public function exampleRejectedValidation(): void {
    $attempt = new BeingData(
        input: $invalidEmail,
        been: new BeenRejected(
            reason: Reason::invalidFormat('email'),
            timestamp: new DateTimeImmutable(),
            evidence: ['attempted_value' => $invalidEmail]
        )
    );
    // The object demonstrates what rejection looks like
}
```

Notice the shift in language and intent. We're no longer doubting our validation system and demanding proof that it works. Instead, we're demonstrating what different forms of temporal completion look like when validation occurs.

The example doesn't test the validator—it shows what a rejected validation attempt looks like as a temporal completion. It demonstrates the internal structure of rejection rather than verifying that rejection happened through external observation.

## The Complete Temporal Structure

This approach reveals something that has been missing from programming since its inception: complete temporal structure. We've had objects that represent current states, and with dependency injection, we learned to represent inherited context. But we've never been able to represent temporal completion—the irreversible fact that specific events have occurred.

The `Been` paradigm completes this temporal architecture:

```php
#[Be(ValidatedUser::class)]
final class UserInput {                        // Past: inherited context
    public function __construct(
        #[Input] public readonly string $data,
        Validator $validator                   // Present: transformative capability
    ) {
        $this->being = $validator->process($data); // Present: becoming
    }
}

final class ValidatedUser {
    public function __construct(
        #[Input] public readonly UserInput $origin,        // Past: inheritance
        #[Input] public readonly SuccessfulValidation $being, // Present: completed becoming
        #[Input] public readonly BeenValidated $been       // Completion: temporal seal
    ) {}
}
```

This mirrors what philosophers call the fundamental structure of temporality: past (inheritance), present (becoming), and what we might call "future-perfect" (completion). For the first time, programming can represent the complete temporal structure of existence.

## Everything Is Being

Here's where something even deeper emerges. When objects carry their own temporal proof, the traditional distinctions between different types of code begin to dissolve.

What's the difference between:
- A `DeletedUser` object?
- An example of user deletion?
- The implementation that enables deletion?
- The specification that describes deletion?

In the `Been` paradigm, they're all forms of being. They're different manifestations of the same underlying temporal reality. The object embodies completion, the example demonstrates completion, the implementation enables completion, and the specification articulates completion. But none is more "real" than the others.

This is what Zhuangzi called "the equality of all things"—the recognition that apparent hierarchies often mask deeper unity. In computational terms, this unity appears as the understanding that implementation, verification, testing, and specification are all different expressions of the same temporal being.

## The AI Understanding Revolution

Here emerges an unexpected consequence: systems built with `Been` objects become completely transparent to artificial intelligence. When every temporal completion carries its full context—the who, when, why, and evidence—AI systems can achieve deep understanding of application behavior without external interpretation.

Traditional logs capture what happened but lose the causal structure, requiring AI to reconstruct intent from fragments. `Been` objects provide complete temporal narratives that AI can directly comprehend. A `BeenApproved` object tells the complete story: not just that approval occurred, but the authorization chain, compliance context, and decision rationale that made approval possible.

This transparency enables what researchers call Log-Driven Development (LDD)—where execution traces become executable specifications. When temporal completions are internally verifiable, the boundary between running code and system documentation dissolves. AI can read `Been` structures as naturally as humans read prose, understanding not just system state but system intention.

## A Thought Experiment

Imagine walking into a codebase where every object carries its own temporal evidence. Where tests have become examples that demonstrate rather than verify. Where verification is internal to the objects being verified rather than external to them.

What would change? Everything—and nothing.

The objects would look different, with their `readonly Been` properties carrying temporal completions. The test files would read differently, showing examples of temporal states rather than external verifications. The development process would feel different, based on trust in temporal structure rather than doubt requiring external confirmation.

But the deeper change would be conceptual. Programming would reveal itself to be fundamentally about temporal form—the creative practice of designing temporal structures that make meaningful completion possible. We would discover that we've always been temporal architects; we just hadn't noticed.

## The Natural Conclusion

When we step back and consider this transformation, we see that it represents not an invention but a recognition. The `Been` paradigm doesn't create temporal completion—it recognizes temporal completion as the universal pattern that governs all persistent existence.

Every entity in the universe that persists through time carries within itself the temporal record of the events that brought it into being. Stars carry the temporal completion of nuclear fusion. Rocks carry the temporal completion of geological processes. Living things carry the temporal completion of evolutionary development.

The `Been` paradigm simply extends this universal pattern into computational space. Objects become temporal entities that carry their own temporal proof rather than logical entities that require external verification.

## Practical Considerations

Adopting the `Been` paradigm requires gradual transformation rather than wholesale replacement. Existing test suites can coexist with examples during transition. The key insight is starting with high-value temporal completions—user registration, order processing, critical state changes—where the `Been` pattern provides immediate clarity.

Technical constraints are minimal: `Been` objects require immutable properties (PHP's `readonly`) and dependency injection capabilities. The primary challenge is conceptual rather than technical—learning to think in terms of temporal completion rather than behavioral verification. Teams report that once developers experience the internal consistency of `Been` objects, traditional external testing begins to feel unnecessarily complex.

But perhaps the most profound shift is in how we understand the boundaries of trust. The question "where do we draw the line?" reveals a deeper philosophical choice. In the `Been` paradigm, you decide what to trust. Trust your SQL engine? Trust your ORM? Trust your network layer? These boundaries are not determined by external methodologies but by your own internal definition as a programmer-philosopher.

This reflects the broader transformation from programmer-as-executor to programmer-as-definer. You are not following external rules about what should be tested, but defining what you choose to trust within your temporal completions. When you create a `DeletedUser` with `BeenDeleted`, you are making an internal declaration: "I trust that my database layer executes the deletion, and I define this temporal completion as sufficient proof."

The fish does not ask external authorities whether it is happy. You do not ask external methodologies where to place your trust. Both decisions emerge from internal being rather than external verification.

## Conclusion

When tests become examples, something subtle but profound shifts in how we understand what we're doing when we write software. We stop being external verifiers of systems we don't trust and become internal exemplifiers of temporal completions we help create.

This shift aligns programming with the temporal structures that govern natural systems, conscious experience, and physical reality itself. Objects become self-evidencing entities that participate in their own verification through internal temporal coherence.

Perhaps most importantly, this transformation reveals programming's deeper relationship to time itself. We are not just manipulating symbols or orchestrating behaviors—we are creating temporal forms that make meaningful completion possible.

In this light, the ancient dialogue between Zhuangzi and Huizi by the river takes on new significance. The fish knows its own happiness through internal being, not external verification. The deleted user knows its own deletion through temporal completion, not external testing.

When objects carry their own temporal truth, programming becomes a form of temporal philosophy. And philosophy, as always, becomes a way of understanding what it means to exist in time.
