# Historical Development Note

## Repository Structure Context

This repository represents the **experimental and learning phase** of Be Framework development. Due to the organic nature of the exploration process, the git history contains a mixture of:

- **v0 implementation** (production candidate)
- **POC (Proof of Concept)** experiments 
- **Documentation** iterations
- **Examples** and learning materials

## Development Philosophy

The mixed structure reflects the authentic journey of discovering ontological programming:

- **Philosophical exploration** alongside technical implementation
- **Iterative refinement** of core concepts (willBe/metamorphose naming, etc.)
- **Historical preservation** of thought processes and design decisions
- **Organic growth** from experiments to framework

## Future Clean Separation

For **v0.1.0**, the framework will migrate to a clean, production-focused repository:

```
Current: github.com/koriym/be-framework (experimental/learning)
Future:  github.com/be-framework/be      (production)
```

## Historical Value

This repository serves as:
- **Complete development history** of ontological programming concepts
- **Design decision documentation** with full context
- **Learning resource** for understanding the framework's philosophical foundations
- **Archive** of the journey from functional to ontological programming

The intermingled history is not a bugâ€”it's a feature that preserves the authentic process of revolutionary framework development.
